# 🛡️ Sentinel AI — Your Digital Guardian in a Crisis

Sentinel AI is an autonomous fact-checking agent designed to combat misinformation during real-time crises. In a bustling city like Mumbai, where heavy monsoons, transport disruptions, or health scares can spark chaos, Sentinel AI provides calm, verified clarity when it’s needed most.

## 🚀 What Sentinel AI Does

- 🕵️ **Monitors in Real Time**  
  Listens to social media, major news outlets, and official government channels 24/7.

- 📡 **Spots High-Impact Claims**  
  Detects rapidly spreading rumors that could affect public safety.

- 🤖 **Autonomously Investigates**  
  Generates search queries like a human, then checks only **trusted, pre-approved sources** (e.g., traffic police, municipal portals, verified news).

- 📢 **Verifies and Reports**  
  Compares the claim with real data and publishes a clear verdict to a public-facing dashboard.

## 🧠 Example
